# LoLSelectHelperPublic
Public repository created for receiving Riot API's production API Key

## Application Description

The users of LoLSelectHelper will be asked to choose 0 to 4 hovered or already selected teammate champions and 0 to 5 already selected enemy champions. Then, the application will display the remaining champions win rates with 0 to 4 chosen teammate champions against 0 to 5 chosen enemy champions.

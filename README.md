# LoLSelectHelperPublic
Public repository created for receiving Riot API's production API Key

## Application Description

The users of LoLSelectHelper will be asked to choose 0 to 4 hovered or already selected teammate champions and 0 to 5 already selected enemy champions. Then, the application will display the remaining champions win rates with 0 to 4 chosen teammate champions against 0 to 5 chosen enemy champions.

## Application Flow Screenshots
Below screenshots are produced with 37,807 match data scraped from op.gg ONLY for testing purposes.
The application will run solely based on data collected from RIOT's database after acquisition of the production API Key.
